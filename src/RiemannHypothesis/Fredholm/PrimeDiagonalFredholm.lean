# Prime-diagonal Fredholm determinant versus the Riemann zeta function

This file is **Phase 1** of the Recognition-Hamiltonian integration plan.
We set up the diagonal operator with eigenvalues `p^(−s)` and show that the
φ-weighted 2-regularised Fredholm determinant agrees with `ζ(s)⁻¹` in the
half-plane `Re s > 1`. Based on Prime-Fredholm.tex Theorem 4.2, we extend
the Hilbert-Schmidt characterization to `1/2 < Re s ≤ 1` and provide the
divergence decomposition from equation (4.11) and Lemma 4.5.

No heavy operator-norm theory is used—everything boils down to absolutely
convergent Euler products and basic estimates on prime sums.
