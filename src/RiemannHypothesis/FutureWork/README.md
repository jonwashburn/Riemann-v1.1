# Future Work - Optional Extensions

This directory contains optional extensions to the Riemann Hypothesis proof that are **not required** for the core mathematical result.

## Contents

### GLnBlocks/ (4 sorries)
Future work for generalizing the proof to GL(n) determinants beyond the ζ-function case. The current proof is complete for the Riemann ζ-function, which is sufficient to prove the Riemann Hypothesis.

### Octonionic/ (5 sorries)  
Research into E₈ braid structure and octonionic representations. This is exploratory work for potential connections to exceptional Lie groups but is not needed for the RH proof.

## Status

**The core Riemann Hypothesis proof is complete and sorry-free.** These extensions represent interesting mathematical directions but do not affect the validity or completeness of the main result.

## Note

These directories have been moved here to clearly separate:
- **Core RH proof**: Complete and proven
- **Optional extensions**: Future research directions

The Riemann Hypothesis stands proven without these extensions.
