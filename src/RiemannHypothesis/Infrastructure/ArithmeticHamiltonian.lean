# Arithmetic Hamiltonian (stub)

The original simple function‚Äêtype `operatorA` has been superseded by the formal
`DiagonalOperator` and `evolutionOperatorFromEigenvalues` in
`FredholmDeterminant.lean`.  We keep this module so that existing import lines
remain valid, but we no longer re-export anything.
