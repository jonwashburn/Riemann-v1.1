# Placeholder lemmas

This file contains placeholder lemmas that are needed for the Riemann Hypothesis proof
but are not directly related to the main proof structure.

⚠️  TODO: CRITICAL - PLACEHOLDER CODE REQUIRES REPLACEMENT ⚠️
All lemmas in this file are mathematical placeholders with stub implementations.
These must be replaced with proper mathematical proofs before the RH proof can be considered valid.

TODO Items:
1. Replace riemann_zeta_functional_equation with proper functional equation proof
2. Replace prime_number_theorem_estimate with rigorous PNT error bound proof
3. Replace prime_reciprocal_sum_diverges with complete divergence proof
4. Consider removing this file entirely and implementing proper proofs inline

WARNING: Current implementations use trivial/stub proofs that do not establish
the required mathematical properties. This invalidates any proof that depends on them.
