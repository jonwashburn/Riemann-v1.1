# Remaining Sorries in Riemann Hypothesis Proof

## Summary
As of Session 5-6 completion, we have 18 remaining sorries in the src directory.

## Breakdown by File

### 1. MissingLemmas.lean (8 sorries)
- `sorry -- Standard: ∑_{n=1}^∞ n^(-s) > 1 for s > 1` - Import from mathlib
- `sorry -- riemannZeta(2n) > 1 for n ≥ 1` - Use Euler product
- `sorry -- Recognition Science: eigenvalue 1 → perfect balance → zero cost` - Core RS theorem
- `sorry -- Zero cost → eigenvalue 1 (spectral theory)` - Spectral theory
- `sorry -- Functional equation (classical result)` - Import from mathlib
- `sorry -- Standard fact: Γ has no zeros` - Import from mathlib
- `sorry -- Contradiction: ζ(1+n) ≠ 0 for n : ℕ` - Use positivity
- `sorry -- Apply identity theorem for holomorphic functions` - Complex analysis

### 2. RecognitionCostFunctional.lean (4 sorries)

## Resolution Strategy

### Phase 1: Import Classical Results from Mathlib
1. Zeta function properties (positivity, special values)
2. Gamma function properties (no zeros)
3. Functional equation
4. Identity theorem for holomorphic functions

### Phase 2: Complete Convexity Analysis
1. Prove convexity of individual terms
2. Establish summability bounds
3. Apply convex optimization theory

### Phase 3: Recognition Science Core
1. Formalize the balance principle
2. Prove critical point uniqueness
3. Complete spectrum-cost connection

### Phase 4: Main Theorem Assembly
1. Connect all pieces
2. Handle edge cases
3. Complete the proof

## Next Steps
1. Import more results from mathlib to reduce classical sorries
2. Focus on the convexity proofs (most concrete)
3. Formalize the Recognition Science principles
4. Complete the main theorem by connecting all components
