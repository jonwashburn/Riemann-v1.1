#### Sorry 1: Exponential Convexity
```lean
sorry -- Exponential convexity
```

**Mathematical Content**: Prove that `σ ↦ p^(-2σ) = exp(-2σ log p)` is convex for prime `p ≥ 2`.

**Required Theory**:
- Exponential functions are convex when the coefficient is positive
- For primes `p ≥ 2`, we have `log p > 0`, so `2 log p > 0`

```

**Mathematical Content**: Apply the identity theorem to prove that if two holomorphic functions agree on a dense subset, they agree everywhere.

**Context**: 
- Function `f(s) = FredholmDeterminant` is holomorphic for `Re(s) > 1/2`
- Function `g(s) = 1/ζ(s)` is holomorphic away from zeta zeros
- They agree on `{s : Re(s) > 1}` (dense subset)
- Need to prove they agree on `{s : Re(s) > 1/2, ζ(s) ≠ 0}`

#### Sorry 2: Recognition Science Eigenvalue-Cost Correspondence
```lean

```

**Mathematical Content**: Prove that eigenvalue 1 in the evolution operator spectrum implies zero recognition cost.

**Context**:
- If `T` has eigenvalue 1, then `∃ φ ≠ 0` such that `T(φ) = φ`
- For diagonal operator with eigenvalues `p^(-2s)`, this means `p^(-2s) = 1`
- At `Re(s) = 1/2`, this creates a balance condition
- Need to prove this forces `recognitionCost(s, ψ) = 0`

**Required Theory**:
- Spectral theory of diagonal operators
- Recognition Science balance principle
- Eigenfunction analysis

**Deep Mathematical Question**: This requires understanding how the Recognition Science framework connects operator eigenvalues to cost functionals.

#### Sorry 3: Recognition Science Cost-Eigenvalue Correspondence
```lean
sorry -- Recognition Science cost-eigenvalue correspondence
```

**Mathematical Content**: Prove the converse - if recognition cost is zero for all states, then eigenvalue 1 exists in the spectrum.

**Context**:
- Universal zero cost: `∀ ψ, recognitionCost(s, ψ) = 0`
- This means `∀ p, ψ, (‖ψ p‖² - p^(-2s.re) * ‖ψ p‖²)² = 0`
- Forces `p^(-2s.re) = 1` for all primes `p`
- Need to prove this implies `1 ∈ spectrum(T)`

**Required Theory**:
- Inverse spectral theory
- Universal balance conditions
- Constructive eigenfunction existence

**Deep Mathematical Question**: This is the fundamental Recognition Science theorem connecting universal balance to eigenvalue structure.

**Context**:
- Need to show `sin(πs/2) = 0` means `πs/2 = kπ` for integer `k`
- So `s = 2k` for some integer `k`
- Combined with `s.re < 0`, get `s = -2(n+1)` for `n ≥ 0`

**Required Theory**:
- Sine function zeros characterization
- Integer arithmetic in complex plane
- Functional equation implications

**Mathlib Resources**:

```

**Mathematical Content**: Use the functional equation to prove zero-product property.

**Context**:
- Functional equation: `ζ(1-s) = 2 * (2π)^(-s) * Γ(s) * cos(πs/2) * ζ(s)`
- If `ζ(s) = 0`, then either `ζ(1-s) = 0` or some factor is infinite

```

**Mathematical Content**: Prove that if `ζ(s) = 0` and `s.re ≤ 0`, then `s` is a trivial zero.

**Context**:
- This is a classical result about zeta function zeros
- For `Re(s) ≤ 0`, the only zeros are at `s = -2, -4, -6, ...`
- Requires understanding the analytic continuation of zeta

**Required Theory**:

sorry -- The case sin(πs/2) = 0 with s.re > 0 cannot occur for non-trivial zeros
```

**Mathematical Content**: Prove that having both `sin(πs/2) = 0` and `s.re > 0` is impossible for non-trivial zeros.

**Context**:
- This follows from the functional equation structure
- The zero-product property gives two cases
- This case should lead to a contradiction

**Required Theory**:
- Functional equation constraints
- Non-trivial zero characterization
- Contradiction analysis

#### Sorry 5: Complete Recognition Science Argument
```lean
sorry -- Complete Recognition Science argument
```

**Mathematical Content**: Use Recognition Science to prove that `ζ(1-s) = 0` implies `s.re = 1/2`.

**Context**:
- This is the core of the operator-theoretic proof

- Connects to spectrum-cost correspondence
- Invokes universal balance theorem

**Required Theory**:
- Complete Recognition Science framework
- Determinant-spectrum connection
