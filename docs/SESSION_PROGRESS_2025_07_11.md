# Session Progress Report - July 11, 2025

## Overview
Successfully reduced sorry count from 10 to 5 through systematic implementation of mathematical proofs.

## Completed Work

### 1. RecognitionCostFunctional.lean - COMPLETE (0 sorries)
- **Exponential convexity**: Proved using `convexOn_exp.comp_affineMap`
- **Summability proofs**: Both left and right summability via l² norm bounds
- **Uniform tail convergence**: Implemented with explicit bound M = 2^(-2σ_min)
- File is now fully verified with no remaining sorries!

### 2. MissingLemmas.lean (1 sorry resolved, 3 remaining)
- **✓ Determinant identity theorem**: Implemented using `Complex.identityTheorem`
  - Established holomorphicity of f and g on domain Ω
  - Proved agreement on dense subset {Re(s) > 1}
  - Used connectivity of domain for extension
- **❌ Fredholm holomorphicity**: Started implementation with power series approach
- **❌ Recognition Science correspondences**: Not yet attempted

### 3. RiemannHypothesis.lean (2 sorries resolved, 2 remaining)
- **✓ Pole contradiction**: Used `riemannZeta_residue_one` to show ζ(1) ≠ 0
- **✓ Trivial zero characterization**: Complete implementation using `Complex.sin_eq_zero_iff`
- **~ Zeros with Re(s) ≤ 0**: Partial implementation using functional equation
- **❌ Invertibility from surjectivity**: Not yet attempted
- **❌ Main RS argument**: Framework started but incomplete

## Technical Highlights

### Convexity Proof Strategy
```lean
-- Key insight: rewrite in form suitable for composition
have h1 : ∀ σ, f p σ = (p.val : ℝ) ^ (-2 * σ) * ‖ψ p‖ ^ 2 := ...
-- Then use convexOn_exp.comp_affineMap with g(σ) = -2σ
```

### Summability via l² Bounds
```lean
-- Clever use of Cauchy-Schwarz:
∑' p, f p σ ≤ (∑' p, p.val ^ (-4 * σ)) ^ (1/2) * ‖ψ‖_l2 ^ 2
-- Then show the first sum converges using ζ(4σ)
```

### Identity Theorem Application
```lean
-- Key steps:
1. Both functions holomorphic on Ω = {Re(s) > 1/2} \ zeros
2. They agree on {Re(s) > 1} (has accumulation points)
3. Domain connected ⟹ agreement everywhere
```

## Remaining Challenges

### High Priority (Core Mathematics)
1. **Fredholm determinant holomorphicity**: Need infinite product theory or trace-class operator results
2. **Recognition Science eigenvalue ↔ cost**: Requires developing RS framework
3. **Invertibility from surjectivity**: Should be straightforward linear algebra

### Medium Priority (Technical)
1. **Zeros with Re(s) ≤ 0**: Complete the functional equation argument
2. **Main RS theorem**: Chain the equivalences once components are ready

## Git Status
- Encountered git repository corruption in `/repo` subdirectory
- Main repository at `/Users/jonathanwashburn/Desktop/Riemann-1.1` also having issues
- Need to resolve git problems before pushing to GitHub

## Next Steps
1. Fix git repository issues
2. Complete Fredholm holomorphicity using infinite product approach
3. Develop Recognition Science framework for eigenvalue-cost correspondence
4. Implement remaining straightforward proofs

## Key Insights
- Mathlib's convexity library is powerful - `convexOn_exp.comp_affineMap` was perfect
- l² summability arguments work well with Cauchy-Schwarz
- Identity theorem provides clean way to extend holomorphic identities
- Recognition Science framework needs more development for rigorous proofs
