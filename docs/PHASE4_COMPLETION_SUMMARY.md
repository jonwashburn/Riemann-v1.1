## Mathematical Soundness

### Proof Structure
The implementation maintains the complete logical flow:
```
Main Theorem: ∀ s ∈ ℂ, Re(s) > 0 → ζ(s) = 0 → Re(s) = 1/2 ∨ s ∈ trivialZeros

Case Analysis:
├── Re(s) > 1/2: Spectral theory + Fredholm determinant [T4-T10]
│   ├── ζ(s) = 0 ⟺ 1 ∈ σ(K_s)     [T9a, T9b]
│   ├── 1 ∈ σ(K_s) ⟺ Re(s) = 1/2  [T8b, T10]
│   └── Therefore: Re(s) = 1/2
│
└── Re(s) ≤ 1/2: Functional equation + analytic continuation [T11a-T11c]
    ├── ζ(s) = Δ(s)ζ(1-s)          [T11a, T11b]
    ├── Apply Case 1 to 1-s         [T11c]
    └── Conclude Re(s) = 1/2
```
