# Riemann Hypothesis Proof Restoration Plan

**Date**: July 7, 2025  
**Status**: üö® **MATHEMATICAL EMERGENCY - IMMEDIATE ACTION REQUIRED**  
**Objective**: Restore mathematical validity to RH proof repository

## Executive Summary

This document outlines the systematic restoration of **232 lines of missing mathematical infrastructure** that are essential for the validity of the claimed Riemann Hypothesis proof. Without this restoration, all claims of proof completeness are mathematically false.

## Critical Situation Assessment

### **What We Know**
- ‚úÖ **Missing Content Located**: Both critical files found in git history
- ‚úÖ **Scope Identified**: Exactly 232 lines of mathematical proofs missing
- ‚úÖ **Recovery Assets Secured**: Original files saved and ready for restoration
- ‚ùå **Compilation Blocked**: Lake manifest version incompatibility prevents testing

### **Mathematical Impact**
- **Current State**: Proof is **INVALID** - missing foundational infrastructure
- **Public Claims**: **FALSE** - repository misleadingly claims completeness
- **Community Risk**: Mathematical community may rely on invalid claims

## Phase 1: Emergency Stabilization (IMMEDIATE - Today)

### 1.1 Public Acknowledgment ‚è∞ **URGENT**

- [ ] **Retract all claims** of proof completeness until restoration verified
- [ ] **Add disclaimer** to all documentation about current invalid status

### 1.2 Technical Prerequisites üîß **CRITICAL**
- [ ] **Fix lake manifest** version incompatibility
- [ ] **Update toolchain** to compatible versions
- [ ] **Verify build system** functionality
- [ ] **Test compilation** of existing (stub) infrastructure

### 1.3 Repository Safeguards üõ°Ô∏è **ESSENTIAL**
- [ ] **Branch protection**: Create restoration branch for safe testing
- [ ] **Backup current state**: Preserve current (invalid) state for comparison
- [ ] **Document process**: Log every restoration step for verification

## Phase 2: Mathematical Infrastructure Restoration (URGENT - This Week)

### 2.1 Core File Restoration üìù **CRITICAL PRIORITY**

- [ ] **Update imports** for current mathlib version
- [ ] **Fix API changes** in Lean 4.8 vs original Lean 4.3
- [ ] **Verify compilation** of all three critical proofs:
  - `diagonal_operator_continuous_proof`
  - `evolution_eigenvalue_bound_proof`  
  - `evolution_diagonal_action_proof`

#### **FredholmVanishingEigenvalueProof.lean** (89 lines)
- [ ] **Restore original content** from commit `9dd87a0`
- [ ] **Update dependencies** for current environment
- [ ] **Verify compilation** of `infinite_product_zero_implies_factor_zero`
- [ ] **Test integration** with main proof structure

### 2.2 Compatibility Updates üîÑ **HIGH PRIORITY**
- [ ] **Mathlib API migration**: Update for v4.8 compatibility
- [ ] **Import path fixes**: Resolve any moved/renamed modules
- [ ] **Syntax updates**: Fix deprecated Lean 4.3 ‚Üí 4.8 syntax
- [ ] **Type signature updates**: Handle any mathlib type changes

### 2.3 Integration Testing üß™ **CRITICAL**
- [ ] **Incremental compilation**: Test each restored file individually
- [ ] **Dependency resolution**: Ensure all imports resolve correctly
- [ ] **Main theorem compilation**: Verify main RH theorem still compiles
- [ ] **Cross-reference validation**: Check all mathematical connections

## Phase 3: Mathematical Verification (CRITICAL - This Week)

### 3.1 Proof Validity Assessment üîç **ESSENTIAL**
- [ ] **Mathematical review**: Verify restored proofs are mathematically sound
- [ ] **Logic flow check**: Ensure proofs support their claimed theorems
- [ ] **Assumption verification**: Validate all mathematical assumptions
- [ ] **Completeness check**: Confirm no circular reasoning or gaps

### 3.2 Integration Verification üîó **CRITICAL**
- [ ] **Dependency mapping**: Verify how restored proofs connect to main theorem
- [ ] **Sorry resolution**: Check if restored proofs resolve any existing sorries
- [ ] **Theorem usage**: Confirm restored theorems are actually used
- [ ] **Mathematical pathway**: Trace complete proof from axioms to conclusion

### 3.3 External Validation üë• **RECOMMENDED**
- [ ] **Peer review**: Have qualified mathematicians review restored content
- [ ] **Independent verification**: Get external confirmation of mathematical validity
- [ ] **Community feedback**: Engage with Lean/mathlib community for validation

## Phase 4: Documentation and Safeguards (IMPORTANT - Next Week)

### 4.1 Comprehensive Documentation üìö
- [ ] **Update all documentation** to reflect actual (not claimed) status
- [ ] **Document restoration process** for transparency
- [ ] **Create verification report** of mathematical validity
- [ ] **Update sorry analysis** with current accurate counts

### 4.2 Quality Assurance üõ°Ô∏è
- [ ] **Implement CI checks** to prevent future infrastructure loss
- [ ] **Add file integrity monitoring** for critical mathematical content
- [ ] **Create backup procedures** for essential proof components
- [ ] **Establish review process** for any future changes to core proofs

### 4.3 Community Communication üì¢
- [ ] **Publish restoration report** with full transparency
- [ ] **Acknowledge the error** and lessons learned
- [ ] **Provide verified status** of proof validity post-restoration
- [ ] **Implement ongoing transparency** measures

## Risk Assessment and Mitigation

### **CRITICAL RISKS**
